## Joining a Project's Work Group

If you are interested in participating in a particular project, visit the [focus area](https://thealliance.ai/){:target="aia-focus-areas"} pages and decide which ones are most interesting to you. Use the form on each of the corresponding pages to tell us about your interests.

An alternative is to use the form on the Alliance's [Become a Collaborator](https://thealliance.ai/become-a-collaborator){:target="aia-website"} page. Check the boxes that look most appropriate and describe your particular interests in the _Message_ box.
