# How to Contribute to this Project

We welcome your contributions to this project. Visit the project's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/the-ai-alliance.github.io/){:target="repo"}, and the [open issues](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/the-ai-alliance.github.io/issues){:target="repo"}, in particular, for areas where you might contribute.

# Joining the Work Group

If you are interested in participating in this project, use the form on the Alliance's [Become a Collaborator](https://thealliance.ai/become-a-collaborator){:target="aia-website"} page to let us know your interests. Check the boxes that look most appropriate and describe your interest in this project in the _Message_ box.

# Making Smaller Contributions

You may not have the time or the expertise to be extensively involved, but you can easily make suggestions for small improvements. Contributing changes as [pull requests](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/the-ai-alliance.github.io/pulls){:target="prs"} is the best way to contribute (and most welcome!). Alternatively, consider [posting issues](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/the-ai-alliance.github.io/issues){:target="issues"}. 

For this documentation itself, the sources are in the GitHub repo's [`docs`](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/the-ai-alliance.github.io/tree/main/docs){:target="repo-docs"} directory. 

However, notice that every page on this website has _Edit this page on GitHub_ links, making it easy to view a page, then go straight to the source to make edits and submit a PR! This is the best way to help us fix typos and make other small improvements.

The repo [README](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/the-ai-alliance.github.io){:target="repo"} explains more details about contributing to this project.

However, all these ways of contributing require you to have a GitHub account. If you don't have one and you want to provide feedback for improvements, then [send us email](mailto:contact@thealliance.ai) with your suggestions. Be sure to mention this particular website, as we have many AI Alliance project websites that look similar!
