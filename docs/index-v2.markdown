# Welcome to The AI Alliance

[The AI Alliance](https://thealliance.ai) Github organization is the place to discover, use, and contribute to a variety of open-source projects for generative AI.

## About Our Projects

Listed here are **Managed Projects**, which are owned by the AI Alliance and indicated below with the _italic_ titles, and **Supported Projects**, which are managed by one or more member organizations in the AI Alliance. Both types of projects are committed to transparency and permissive use licensing, and they are open to the community for new contributors. Learn more about our [project governance](https://thealliance.ai/governance).

          The <a href="https://the-ai-alliance.github.io/open-agent-hub/" target="oah">Open Agent Hub</a> is a collaboration of open-source AI projects and domain-specific work groups that seeks to make AI Agents successful in the real world through fast experimentation and distillation of learning into reusable tools, reference examples, and applications.
        </td>
        <td>
          The Open Data and Models program is building models needed for successful agent-based applications across domains and use cases. Since good datasets are essential for training and tuning good models, and for application patterns like <a href="https://the-ai-alliance.github.io/glossary/glossary/#retrieval-augmented-generation" target="glossary">RAG</a> and <a href="https://the-ai-alliance.github.io/glossary/glossary/#agent" target="glossary">Agents</a>, the AI Alliance is cataloging permissive data sets and helping to build new ones where needed, all with clear licenses for open use and backed by unambiguous provenance and governance constraints.
