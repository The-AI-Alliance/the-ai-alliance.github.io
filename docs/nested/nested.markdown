# TODO - nested section "index" page

TODO replace with your content (or delete folder).

An example of a nested section. This is the "index" page for the nested section. Note that URLs elsewhere, like in `../index.markdown` are written `{{site.baseurl}}/nested/nested`.

Note the [`nested_child`]({{site.baseurl}}/nested/nested_child/) page.
