# Welcome to the AI Alliance

You found the [AI Alliance](https://thealliance.ai){:target="_blank"} Github organization, where you can learn, use, and contribute to our open source AI projects.

The projects on this page are a prioritized set from across our community, including two types: **Supported Projects** are led and managed by a Member(s) of the AI Alliance (a company, a non-profit, etc.). **Managed Projects** are owned by the AI Alliance. Both types of projects commit to minimum requirements on transparency, contributor opportunity and IP, permissive use licensing, and community conduct. Learn more about our project governance [here](https://thealliance.ai/governance){:target="_blank"}.
